DESCRIPTION: Paragliding at Arambol Beach is an experience in iteself. Be a free flying bird! Climb atop a small hill, strap up your harness and thrust yourself in the air, up and away! Paragliding as an adventure sport involves a great rush, as you can have a bird's eye view of your scenic surroundings just sailing in the air without any support from external factors.

REVIEW : ixigo
Paragliding is best enjoyed here between October and February. 

Paragliding is held during the day when the wind currents are strong enough.
