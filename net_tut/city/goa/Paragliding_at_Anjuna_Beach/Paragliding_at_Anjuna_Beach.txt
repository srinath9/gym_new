DESCRIPTION: Be a free flying bird! Climb atop a small hill, strap up your harness and thrust yourself in the air, up and away! Paragliding as an adventure sport involves a great rush, as you can have a bird's eye view of your scenic surroundings just sailing in the air without any support from external factors. Goa is amongst India's favourite spots for professional gliders all over the world. If you aren't a trained glider, don't worry, you can still glide in the company of a professional! Do I see a smile spreading on your face now?
