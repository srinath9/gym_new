DESCRIPTION: If you want to get a bird's eye-view of the Goan coastline and the lofty Western Ghats, para-sailing is the thing for you. A strong 300 feet rope is attached to a speedboat at one end and to a parachute at the other, into which you'll be carefully and securely harnessed. Once the speedboat takes off from the beach, you'll be suspended in air through the colourful parachute, with the wind gushing in your ears and the vistas below delighting your eyes. Don't miss the majestic Fort Aguada if you're parasailing from Candolim or Sinquerim beaches. The season for parasailing is usually between October and April, when the skies are clear and the winds blow at the just-right speed, though you can parasail at anytime of the year except during monsoons (July to September).

REVIEW : ixigo

 Make sure the harness is secured properly.





 You'll get better rates if you reach the beach before the crowd gets in, say around 10:00 AM.





 Avoid this activity if it's raining or too windy.





 Best time: October to April
