DESCRIPTION: Feel the waves beneath your feet, while you're pulled along by a speed-boat. Water-skiing is a sport that is soon becoming popular in Goa, despite the fact that it requires some training and practice before actually undertaking it. A speed-boat usually pulls you forward and takes you across the sea, while you stand perched on surf-boards and hold onto a long rope attached to the boat. It's a tricky water-sport and requires one to be physically agile and alert at all times. Get ready for an actual adrenaline rush, while you literally hold on for your life!

REVIEW : ixigo

 Make sure you're a good swimmer before you take on this activity.





 You'll need to be physically fit for this, especially your back should be strong and flexible so that you can manouvre the surf-boards smoothly.





 Always ensure that there is a trainer professional on the speedboat other than the speedboat driver.





 Best time: October to April
