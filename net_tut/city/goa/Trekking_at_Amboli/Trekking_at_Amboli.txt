DESCRIPTION: If trekking is your cup of tea, there's nothing like Western Ghats to do it. And when it comes to Western Ghats, there's no place better than Goa. A trek up these stretches looks like walking the lands of Enid Blyton's Famous Five. As you trudge your way to the summit, don't forget to soak in the natural splendour that's splattered all around. The Sahyadris and dense woods at Goa make for the most serene of surroundings for trekking. 
  Sports organisers will provide you with all the trekking gear, and all that you need to pack is a good pair of trekking shoes and plenty of gutsy spirit.
